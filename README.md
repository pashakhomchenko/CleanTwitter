## How does it work?

This extenstion blocks the annoying parts of Twitter/X UI by utilizing [content scripts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Content_scripts). Essentially, we inject a JS script into Twitter/X webpage that finds unwanted elements and then deletes or hides them.
